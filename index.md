## About me

I am [Norman Benet](https://es.linkedin.com/in/NormanBenet), student of the
[Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s
subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Ricard Pillosu](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu).

## To start, here it is a brief explanation of production plan on videogames:

It is a document created **collaborative among the team** (if it is a small team, it will be done with the whole team, if it is a big one, it will be done with the leads of each section), as it affects each member of the team directly. 
It serves as a comprehensive task list of everything that needs to be implemented in the game and all of the components thereof. Which is then given a man-month requirement individually to help to define a most likely rough timeline for the development engagement.
There are professional project management tools like Jira or MS Project that helps the production plan. But, the simple spreadsheet production plan is a decent solution that works in a snap.

## 5 Aspects to take in account for doing a production plan:

### First of all:

We have to know that the game production pipeline is divided into 3 branches:

1·**PRE-PRODUCTION:** is time to have just an idea of a game from where to start building (e.g. “Make a game about number matching”).Having this, it is time to define all the details and came out with a **solid** game concept. Documents like [Game Design Document "GDD"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_design_document), [Technical Design Document "TDD"](https://www.studytonight.com/3d-game-engineering-with-unity/tdd-and-gdd), [Paper Prototype](http://gamedevelopertips.com/paper-prototyping-game-development/) are done here.

2·**PRODUCTION:** here is where the designer, engineers, producers and basically all the members of the team will work together to bring the game to life. It is important to know that changes in this phase will cost a lot in terms of time and money to invest.

3·**POST-PRODUCTION:** is the time to get your game to an audience as large as possible and first, solve all the bugs possible with testers on a Beta. Then, the game is ready to buy. Developers can add new features to expand the game in order to increase the retention of the game.

### Second:

Now, knowing the pipeline a question can come to us: **When is the Production Plan done?**

It is done at the earliest of the pipeline, on the pre-production, to have a schedule for the Concept creation and all the details defined. But, once the GDD and TDD are done, we have the enough information to determine the staff size. After the staffing plan* the planning will be mostly accurrate (Mostly? Yes, making games is "a bit" unpredictable). 

### Third:

The production plan estimates the expenditure of the total production of the game. A simple list of costs on making a game could be this one:

Organized by categories the costs are the following:

·**FIXED COST:** salaries, electricity, rent of the studio, etc.

·**VARIABLE COST:** software license fees, short-turn contractors, travels, etc.

The budget could be divided in 5 branches:

1·**SALARIES**.

2·**GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE**.

3·**RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT**.

4·**LICENSES**.

5·**TRAVEL & ENTERTAINTMENT**.

### Fourth:

Momentarily, we basically comprehend how the costs are broken. The aim of the production plan is not leaving anything open and contemplate all the hypothetical problems and their solutions. I would like to mention a sentence that reflects what, probably, will happen if there are vulnerable parts of the plan:

-*Anything that can go wrong will go wrong* - Murphy's Law.

### Fifth:

Production schedules are by their nature imprecise, as it is entirely based on estimates and not actual development. This directly means that when you make a schedule, give a development time buffer. You will be glad you did. 

The buffer could be this: **_YOUR ESTIMATE + 20%_**. 

## Order & Must-haves to make a good Production plan:

<img src="https://tops-secure-graphics.grocerywebsite.com/GraphicsShoppingList/ShoppingListIcon_221x221.png">

These is the order and the must-haves to follow to make a good Production plan: Initial planning, Feature list, Assign tasks, Dependencies, Schedule, Milestones.

·**INITIAL PLANNING**: The design framework laid at the origin of the proposal will detemine the course for the entire project's development. As mentioned before, at this step nothing is set in stone, but you should attempt to be as acurrarte as possible.

·**FEATURE LIST**: Once the GDD and TDD are done, analyze it and determine the game's list of requirements. Each requirement needs to be splited into a list of features that will be required to implement it.

·**STAFFING PLAN**: Lists where and when is the full-time staff required. Largest part of the budget is for employee's salaries. A good thing to use is the man-month, the [definition](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/man-month) is *"One person's working time for a month, or the equivalent, used as a measure of how much work or labor is required or consumed to perform some task"*. It is a **unit of cost**, not a unit of time.

*Image from a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGreTjoWOBI) about man-month*.

·**ASSIGN TASKS**: Now it is when the team work together (if it is a small team, the whole team work together, otherwise it will be done with the leads of each section) to break the features into tasks for each department. Then, the lead of each group has to create initial requirement estimates for every task and assign them to team members. After this, he must ensure, with the members of his team, that his estimates are correct and reasonable.

·**DEPENDENCIES**: Project manager takes all the task estimates and place them into a project management software (Jira, MS Project, Excel or similars). Once this is done, the manager **must** look at the tasks and match dependencies between teams. Doing that prevents creating a feature before that it is needed (e.g. To fully implement a racing game, you would not schedule the coding of fuel durability before the physics system is complete).  

·**SCHEDULE**: Here things get particularly complicated. The manager assigns estimated start and end dates for each task (Gantt chart). Manager has to take in account here the last aspect mention before, giving buffer to the schedule for things like employee sick time, unexpected delays on features, etc. This step is time-consuming, but brings directly an idea of how long will the project take to complete.

<img src="http://eventcrowd.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Every-Event-Manager-Dreads-These-Painful-Moments-768x380.jpg"> *It will be frustrating to complete this part, but the more accurate it is, the better results you will obtain*.

·**MILESTONES**: Indicate the percentage of the tasks have been compeleted. Give the team specific goals to aim for and when working with a publisher, milestones determine when the developing studio is paid. Usually, a game has these three milestones: **Vertical Slice** (representative sample of the game you want to make. Key features of art, code and design), **Alpha** (game playable from the begininng to the end and all features implemented) and **Beta** (everything is solid, just fix bugs).

## Way to make easier your Production plan:

**Q**uality, **C**ost, **D**elivery (QCD):

Is an analysis used to assess different components of the production process. **Quality** refers to the attribute expected by the client, **Cost** refers to the appropriate resource required to undertake the service and **Delivery** specify distributing completed service to client in a timely style. 

Quality on video games is difficult to analyse. But being on time and under budget is where you are going to have a game that is, actually, going to ship or not.  The Cost & Delivery are the most important here (unless you have unlimited money and time), the way to measure these things are the man-month before mentioned and directly reflects the common sentence "*Time is money*".
